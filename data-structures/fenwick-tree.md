a fenwick tree (aka binary indexed tree) is a data structure that supports efficiently finding the sum of a range of values in a **static array**.

### Complexity
| construction | linear |
| point update | logarithmic |
| range sum | logarithmic |
| range update | logarithmic |
| adding index | n/a |
| removing index | n/a |

in a fenwick tree, a cell in the array is responsible for other cells, not just for "itself".
**Note: fenwick trees are 1-based**
