# Data Structures
A data structure is a way of organizing data, the idea being to make operations on the data more efficient.

## Abstract data type
An abstract data type is akin to an interface - you define the interface of the data type but not its implementation. A popular example is a Queue. The behavior/operations of a queue are known but there are numerous implementations for a queue (e.g. using an array, using a linked list).
